<h3>Twilight</h3>
<p>it was talking about supernatural vamps who are friendly with human and they look the best in their life and they are undefeatable! also each one has a uniques super power!</p>
<h3>The One Hundred</h3>
<p>it's way beyond the real world in events but it was so true about how ppl will deal with eachother and that everyone cares only to his ppl or himself at the end! and it was super adventurous!</p>

<p>funny, cute and drama, I loved it when I was a kid and I loved it grown up even the new version I loved it too!</p>
